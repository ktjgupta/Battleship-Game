# Battle Ship Game

This project is built to represent the classic Battle ship board game and mimic its game 
features. The game is played normally by 2 people where each person chooses where they want to
place each of their 5 ships of given length on their board. Once all the ships have been 
deployed, each player guesses where the opponents shup could be. If guessed right, it is a hit.
The first person to hit all of the opponents ships wins. This game has the same game play but 
instead of playing with two people, one person plays against the computer.
