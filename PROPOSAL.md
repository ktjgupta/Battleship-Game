I would really like my project to simulate the classic battleship board game. The way this game works is that 
each player receives 5 ships of finite length: Carrier - 5, Battleship – 4, Cruiser – 3, Submarine – 3, 
Destroyer – 2. The player then has the option to put these submarines across their 10x10 grid either vertically
or horizontally.  Once all the ships are placed, gameplay begins. Players take turn picking positions on the 
opponents grid where they think their ships are. If they don't hit anything, it is a miss. Otherwise, it is a
hit and
